    Used both for the very first game and every restart. A restart can't
    just build a new ``GameState`` and keep the existing ``GameEngine``:
    ``GameEngine``'s default ``GameOverRule`` (``KingCaptureRule``) is
    stateful and explicitly documented as scoped to a single game — see
    that class's own docstring: "don't share a ``KingCaptureRule`` across
    two ``GameEngine`` instances." Reusing one would carry over which
    colours it saw as "armed" (and already lost) from the previous game,
    so the new game could report itself over immediately. A fresh
    ``GameEngine`` (which primes a fresh ``KingCaptureRule`` from the
    fresh board at construction) avoids that entirely.

    Also registers a fresh ``SoundTriggerObserver``/``GameLifecycleObserver``
    pair on the new engine (see ui/observers.py) — fresh per call for the
    same reason the engine itself is: ``GameLifecycleObserver`` tracks
    per-game "have I already logged this game's start" state, so reusing
    one across a restart would silently swallow the new game's own start
    log. This is purely additive: ``ScoreTracker``/``MoveHistoryTracker``
    keep working exactly as before, via their own snapshot-diffing in the
    render loop, not as Observers.
